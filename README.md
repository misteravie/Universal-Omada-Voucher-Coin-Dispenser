Hello! Thank you for purchasing our Diagram and Source Code.

Minor Bugs:

*First insert of coins on each rate to purchase voucher code has error
	e.g ( You have 6 digits voucher code combination in 3 rates which is Php 3, Php 5, and Php 10. The first time you insert coins on each rate will have an error
on the display of the 6 digits voucher code combination. However, the second insert of coin will be already fix and stable on the display.)
